      <description>&lt;p&gt;I used to stress a lot about the &amp;ldquo;efficiency&amp;rdquo; of how I was using up all the minutes in my day. I&amp;rsquo;d to cram in as much as possible into time. eg. read on a 10 minute train, write code in the half hour before bed, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While I stressed about it a lot, I never found that I did the &amp;ldquo;10x&amp;rdquo; things I read about that were supposed to emerge as a result of this extra &amp;ldquo;efficiency&amp;rdquo;. For example I have only finished one of the three side projects I started in 2016, despite promising myself that those wouldn&amp;rsquo;t take long.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>&#34;Full-stack&#34; and why I don&#39;t like it</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week I went to a jobs event, recruiting for my company. I was there on my own, and recruiting is a pretty new experience for me, so I was kinda excited about it. The attendees were a mix of graduates, bootcampers, and a few more senior developers, but mostly the crowd were looking for their first or second job. I enjoy going out and talking to people about their experiences with software &amp;ndash; I think breadth of knowledge is really valuable &amp;ndash; so I found it interesting seeing what other people are looking for in a job. I&amp;rsquo;ve only ever had one; maybe I&amp;rsquo;ve aimed for all the wrong things!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
