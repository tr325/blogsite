      <description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;tweet.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;A tweet from @deathbybadger saying: &amp;quot;have started saying the subtext out loud in conversation eg. &amp;quot;by the way I&#39;m asking for reassurance&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;this look means I want you to put that down so we can talk&amp;quot; and honestly the success rate in getting what I want is much higher&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Saying the quiet part out loud” is a phrase I’ve just made up, to describe a method of building alignment on practices within a team. It’s the habit of stating why you are doing things a certain way, even when you would assume it’s obvious.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Cull your dependencies</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Anyone  writing code professionally in December 2021 will remember the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wired.com/story/log4j-flaw-hacking-internet/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;fun&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59669297&#34;&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-12-15/log4j-cyber-security-flaw-which-has-online-experts-worried/100703290&#34;&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wsj.com/articles/hackers-exploit-log4j-flaw-at-belgian-defense-ministry-11640020439?mod=article_inline&#34;&gt;Log4J&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252510860/What-is-Log4Shell-and-why-are-we-panicking-about-it&#34;&gt;vulnerability&lt;/a&gt;. For those that weren&amp;rsquo;t - this was a critical security error that allowed attackers to run any code they wanted on your servers. The root cause was a logging library, Log4J, that is used by most projects that are writting in Java.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s usually used to write code something like:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;log.info(&amp;quot;Process completed successfully&amp;quot;);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;which will then appear in your logs, allowing you to track your application&amp;rsquo;s behaviour. Pretty innocuous stuff.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Does the software industry learn?</title>
      <link>https://tomrenner.com/posts/does-the-software-industry-learn/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Institutional knowledge&amp;rdquo; - the information that a company collectively knows - is a familiar concept to anyone involved in hiring processes. When an individual leaves who has knowledge the organisation needs, companies will organise offboarding sessions to keep that knowledge within the institution. Maybe they&amp;rsquo;ll even try to hire someone with similar experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lots of companies similarly try to optimise for &amp;ldquo;Institutional learning&amp;rdquo;, especially smaller firms. This makes a lot of sense - smaller companies don&amp;rsquo;t have the resources to buy in extra experience, so they focus on rapidly expanding the experience of their existing employees. It also fits really well with the agile philosophy of fast development cycles to maximise your knowledge about customers&amp;rsquo; needs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Should we welcome or fear the Metaverse?</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kit Wilson writes in The Spectator about Facebook’s new venture into the Metaverse, a concept that most of us probably hadn’t heard of until last week. To layout the roadmap for what our journey into this new digital reality might look like, Kit joins the podcast along with Tom Renner, a software engineer for NavVis.

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;coming-to-grips-with-devops-metrics&#34;&gt;Coming to grips with DevOps metrics&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my team we have been considering ways to monitor our own performance, and finding some ways to contextualise our ongoing process and quality improvements. Like many other teams, we&amp;rsquo;ve landed on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.blueoptima.com/blog/how-to-measure-devops-success-why-dora-metrics-are-important&#34;&gt;DORA metrics&lt;/a&gt; as a good way of doing this.  These four key metrics are an easy way to understand what adjectives like &amp;ldquo;maintainable&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;reliable&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;efficient&amp;rdquo; mean in practice when applied to software and teams, and the provide a way of comparing team performance across teams and over time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Make yourself a happy place in your inbox - a mindfulness tip for your working day</title>
      <link>https://tomrenner.com/posts/make-yourself-a-happy-place/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Your work inbox is probably not a place that sparks joy. It&amp;rsquo;s full of people asking you to do things, complaints that something hasn&amp;rsquo;t been done, and 571 messages marked urgent.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In fact email is usually considered to be a hindrance, with many productivity guides recommending simply ignoring your email for large periods of the day, blocking out that time for focussed work. The consensus is that your work inbox is just a place that generates distractions, and contains never-ending to-do lists that nag away at you throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Twitter network graphing with Gephi</title>
      <link>https://tomrenner.com/posts/twitter-graphing-with-gephi/</link>

      <guid>https://tomrenner.com/posts/twitter-graphing-with-gephi/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Gephi is a piece of software for visualising graph networks. It&amp;rsquo;s a powerful tool, and to use it fully requires significant domain knowledge that I don&amp;rsquo;t possess, but fortunately it&amp;rsquo;s still fascinating to play around with as an amateur!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a techie, to me the obvious networks to graph are those created by the big Social Networks - YouTube, Facebook, etc. It&amp;rsquo;s not hugely surprising to find that mostly these graphs mostly aren&amp;rsquo;t available for querying, but excitingly there is a plugin that allows you to stream in live data from Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>XTC discusses Basecamp&#39;s Shape-Up</title>
      <link>https://tomrenner.com/posts/xtc-basecamp-shape-up/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week I facilitated a session at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.meetup.com/eXtreme-Tuesday-Club-XTC/&#34;&gt;XTC&lt;/a&gt;, where we discussed the new product development framework from Basecamp, &lt;a href=&#34;https://basecamp.com/shapeup&#34;&gt;Shape Up&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/thomasankcorn&#34;&gt;Thomas Ankorn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was a really interesting discussion with people exploring the ideas openly, guided by questions posed by Thomas to get the conversation started.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve summarised the points that came up in the discussion, reconstructed from memory and the collected post-its of scribbles at the end of the evening.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-what-problems-does-this-solve&#34;&gt;1. What problems does this solve?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We started by looking at the positives of the framework, trying to identify strengths that would help mitigate problems we have encountered in our own teams.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Temple of Fail</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DISCLAIMER:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;This was not my idea - I picked it up from Jane Nicholson at an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.meetup.com/eXtreme-Tuesday-Club-XTC/&#34;&gt;XTC&lt;/a&gt; event, who was introduced to it by Jess Gilbert (who in turn, I am told, got it from someone else). This post is just explaining why I believe it can be a useful exercise, not any truly original thinking!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the things that is really important to me is that my team and I keep learning at work. As such, fostering a learning environment is kinda key. I think we do that pretty well at Haplo &amp;ndash; we have hired nearly exclusively early-career developers to our tech team for several years now, and one of the key points most hires mention as to why they join is that they feel it&amp;rsquo;s a good place to learn quickly, with the requisite support early on in their career.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>&#34;Efficiency&#34; is bad for your health, and your learning</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I used to stress a lot about the &amp;ldquo;efficiency&amp;rdquo; of how I was using up all the minutes in my day. I&amp;rsquo;d to cram in as much as possible into time. eg. read on a 10 minute train, write code in the half hour before bed, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While I stressed about it a lot, I never found that I did the &amp;ldquo;10x&amp;rdquo; things I read about that were supposed to emerge as a result of this extra &amp;ldquo;efficiency&amp;rdquo;. For example I have only finished one of the three side projects I started in 2016, despite promising myself that those wouldn&amp;rsquo;t take long.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Offline knowledge, buses, and note-taking</title>
      <link>https://tomrenner.com/posts/offline-knowledge/</link>

      <guid>https://tomrenner.com/posts/offline-knowledge/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a team having knowledge that lives only in your head is a terrible thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Humans are forgetful&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Humans are creative, especially when problem-solving&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Computers are not creative&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Computers are not forgetful&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So we should get the computers to remember things, and allow the humans to do the creative parts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Writing software is a creative activity. You start with a blank text file and end up convincing people to give you their identity details in exchange for the ability to poke someone over Facebook. If that&amp;rsquo;s not creative I don&amp;rsquo;t know what is.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Setting up a bottom-end Chromebook for development</title>
      <link>https://tomrenner.com/posts/setting-up-chromebook/</link>

      <guid>https://tomrenner.com/posts/setting-up-chromebook/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I like being able to code wherever I am. &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Unfortunately&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;, my 15&amp;quot; laptop bought to run simulations for my degree still runs like a dream, so I can&amp;rsquo;t really justify buying myself a replacement for it. So instead, just over a year ago, I decided to get something that is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lightweight&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cheap&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Allows me to code on the go&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Looking around a bit, a budget Chromebook seemed like a good choice. I settled on an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.asus.com/uk/Laptops/ASUS_Chromebook_C201/&#34;&gt;Asus Chromebook C201&lt;/a&gt;, which cost me £190. It has 4GB of RAM, a 16GB SSD, and weighs under a kilo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Getting the right scale</title>
      <link>https://tomrenner.com/posts/getting-the-right-scale/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Agile tells us that the most critical thing for getting software right is not up front design, but getting something out there and used, and then incorporating feedback. By getting feedback early, you are able to respond faster, changing your (initially incorrect) design in small steps towards a better solution. This works better in practice than designing everything at the start very carefully, which feels rigid and inflexible in the face of new information over the course of a project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A quick guide for productive development</title>
      <link>https://tomrenner.com/posts/a-quick-guide-for-productive-development/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://tomrenner.com/posts/a-quick-guide-for-productive-development/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is upsettingly easy to work hard without being productive. &lt;a href=&#34;https://theleanstartup.com/book&#34;&gt;The Lean Startup&lt;/a&gt; includes a quote I really liked:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;[People] feel that a good day is one in which they did their job well all day.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The point being that this doesn&amp;rsquo;t account for whether you are doing the right work. This is a really common trap to fall in to. I know I have often worked really hard on something and produced code I&amp;rsquo;m very happy with, only to talk to my boss or the client and find that nobody else seems to be nearly as pleased with what I&amp;rsquo;ve produced as I am.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://tomrenner.com/posts/the-customer-is-always-right/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A theme of the last few books I&amp;rsquo;ve read has been user testing. Specifically, that it is completely unreasonable to suggest that you could produce a system that will work smoothly in production without first getting several actual human users unfamiliar with your system, from your clients or in a related industry, to road-test the system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think anyone can see that this is a good idea. It&amp;rsquo;s far too easy to make assumptions about the users&amp;rsquo; requirements or use cases. Without user testing software would rarely solve the problems it was designed for.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-do-i-want-to-have-my-own-site&#34;&gt;Why do I want to have my own site?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Narcissism mostly. I found the domain was available, decided as a self-respecting developer I should probably buy it. But then there&amp;rsquo;s no point owning a domain if you don&amp;rsquo;t put something there. So that was it really - I had to I had to get my act together and actually write the thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-enjoy-developing&#34;&gt;I enjoy developing&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a person who finds it hard to devote time outside of office hours to write code. I suspect it&amp;rsquo;s because I hate fun. Whatever the reason, if I&amp;rsquo;m not doing something &lt;em&gt;useful&lt;/em&gt;, I won&amp;rsquo;t bother. So having decided I would like to code more, I had to find something useful to write.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week I went to a jobs event, recruiting for my company. I was there on my own, and recruiting is a pretty new experience for me, so I was kinda excited about it. The attendees were a mix of graduates, bootcampers, and a few more senior developers, but mostly the crowd were looking for their first or second job. I enjoy going out and talking to people about their experiences with software &amp;ndash; I think breadth of knowledge is really valuable &amp;ndash; so I found it interesting seeing what other people are looking for in a job. I&amp;rsquo;ve only ever had one; maybe I&amp;rsquo;ve aimed for all the wrong things!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
